# TimeConversion
This project was created for my software quality assurance class during my time attending college.

It is a barebones console application I built with C# that asks for user to input a value, then select the unit that the value is measured in then finally asks which unit the user would like to convert the value to and displays the result. It was quite a basic project but I think the purpose of this assignment was to teach us how to use git but also teach the students how to effectively manage code stubs and think about what types of test cases would be appropriate for such a program.

Inside the project folders, the 'complete' version of the project is labelled as 'Project 3C' as the assignment required me to write 3 different variations of the same program with '3A' and '3B' being what I refer to as 'incomplete' variants.

There are no (automated)test cases for this particular assignment because the professor advised us to manually initiate test cases, I have included a companion document and a table outlining the test cases I chose to test this program with and the results of the tests.
